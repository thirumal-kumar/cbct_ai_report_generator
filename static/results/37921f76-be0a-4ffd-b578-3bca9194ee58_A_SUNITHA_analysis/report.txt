1. Scan Details
- Source file: /tmp/cbct_upload_37921f76-be0a-4ffd-b578-3bca9194ee58/37921f76-be0a-4ffd-b578-3bca9194ee58_A_SUNITHA.dcm
- Voxel size (approx): (0.4, 0.4, 0.4)

2. Image Quality
- Image quality adequate for automated analysis unless stated otherwise.

3. Findings
- Volume shape (Z,Y,X): (400, 400, 400)
- Mean HU (approx): 240.3; min 0.0; max 4095.0
- Maxillary sinus: estimated aeration mask present; voxel count 47492513 (quantitative assessment).
- Airway volume (automated estimate): 2985050.8 mm³
- Mandibular canal: no clear tubular canal region identified by heuristic.
- Periapical low-density candidates: 6 (low confidence). Correlate with periapical radiographs.
- Cortical thickness (mean projection approx): 0.00 (voxels units).

4. Impression
- Possible periapical low-density region(s) identified (low confidence). Correlate clinically and with periapical radiographs.
- No gross destructive osseous lesion identified on this automated pass.

5. Recommendations
- Correlate imaging with clinical findings and intraoral/periapical radiographs.
- For implant planning, perform dedicated cross-sectional measurements at proposed site.
- If suspicious lesion persists, consider targeted CBCT/clinical evaluation or specialist referral.
