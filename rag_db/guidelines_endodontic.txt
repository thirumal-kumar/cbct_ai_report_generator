Endodontic CBCT Guidelines:
- Evaluate canal curvature and calcification.
- Identify additional canals (MB2, DL canals, etc.).
- Check proximity of apex to sinus/mandibular canal.
- Assess periapical radiolucency: size, borders, cortical breach.
- Observe vertical root fractures, cracks, post position.
- Identify perfusion, ledges, missed canals.
